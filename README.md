ðŸ¦‹ Image Classification of 300 Species using iNaturalist + PyTorch & TIMM

This repository contains an image classification pipeline trained on the iNaturalist dataset, covering 300 species of plants, animals, and insects. The project demonstrates the complete workflow â€” from dataset parsing and preprocessing, to model training with PyTorch & TIMM backbones, to deployment via a Streamlit app.
